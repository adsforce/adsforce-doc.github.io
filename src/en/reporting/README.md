## Report Parameters

Adsforce provides ROI reports to help App marketers measure the effectiveness of their ad campaigns. By combining in-app activity and lifetime value data with ad cost and other campaign details, Adsforce can deliver real-time ROI reports on app install campaigns.

The ROI reports include additional data for measuring the effectiveness of your campaigns — campaign cost, clicks and in some cases impressions. Using the data, Adsforce also provides you with analysis of your campaign’s Return on Investment (ROI) and average Effective Cost per Installation (eCPI) over time.
