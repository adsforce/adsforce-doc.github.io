# Reporting

## Introduction

Adsforce's Partners Report provides aggregated performance reports per source/campaign.

Important: This lifetime value (LTV) report aggregates the overall (all time until present) performance of the installs/users generated during the reporting dates ( {from_date} to {to_date} ).

This means that the report includes all in-app events that occurred after the selected date range.

Report Time:UTC(GMT)

## Interpreting the Data

Adsforce provides ROI reports to help app marketers measure the effectiveness of their ad campaigns. By combining in-app activity and lifetime value data with ad cost and other campaign details, Adsforce can deliver real-time ROI reports on app install campaigns.

The ROI reports include additional data for measuring the effectiveness of your campaigns — campaign cost, clicks and in some cases impressions. Using the data, Adsforce also provides you with analysis of your campaign’s Return on Investment (ROI) and average Effective Cost per Installation (eCPI) over time.
